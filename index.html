  <h1> Emily's Reflection #9 </h1>

    <p>It’s not as hard to make graphs but it is tedious to put all the data together. Since, you have to put one numbers to one column then do it again but next column. It’s like google sheet which you put data on the columns and make graph. It’s simple and easy to follow. I would like it if making the graph a different design easier and less steps. I never made graphs in illustration before but it was fun and I learned lot from it. The challenges I faced during it was finding a way to make it different and entertaining to look at. It also hard to know what tools to make the graph look cooler.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For, example, you can make the pie chart to have a hole in the middle but it didn’t work for me and I don’t know how so I didn’t use it. I learned that you can find a graph in the tool bar and you can make the graph into 3D by going to effect then 3D then choose extrude and bevel… I also learned that first column can be data box that shows you the color and name then second column is the data. I hope to gain from this course is knowledge of making things in illustration to help with my future portfolio and making things for my game. I would hope to gain the knowledge of making graphs so I can use them in the future when building graphs for people or myself.</p>
